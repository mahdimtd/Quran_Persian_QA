            "\n",
            "خداوند در قرآن کریم به صراحت فرموده است که او برای بندگانش کافی است و نیازی به غیر او نیست. آیه «و من یتوکل علی الله فکفاه» (طلاق: 3) به همین موضوع اشاره دارد. همچنین در روایت ذکر شده، وقتی از امام جعفر صادق (ع) پرسیده شد که چرا در سوره حمد از خداوند استعانت می‌طلبیم، ایشان فرمودند: اگر امور به تو سپرده شده، چه نیازی به یاری دیگران داری؟\n",
            "\n",
            "اما سوال شما درباره توسل شیعیان به امامان (ع) است. در پاسخ باید گفت که توسل به امامان (ع) به معنای پرستش یا شرک به خدا نیست، بلکه به معنای درخواست واسطه از کسانی است که نزد خداوند منزلت بالایی دارند. شیعیان معتقدند که امامان (ع) واسطه فیض الهی هستند و می‌توانند دعای بندگان را به درگاه خداوند ببرند.\n",
            "\n",
            "این اعتقاد با آیه قرآن «یا أیها الذین آمنوا اتقوا الله و ابتغوا الیه وسیلة» (مائده: 35) نیز سازگار است. در این آیه، خداوند مؤمنان را به تقوا و جستجوی وسیله به سوی خود دعوت می‌کند. شیعیان، امامان (ع) را همان وسیله می‌دانند که خداوند به مؤمنان معرفی کرده است.\n",
            "\n",
            "همچنین، در روایت آمده است که وقتی عبدالملک اموی از امام صادق (ع) پرسید که چه فایده‌ای در سوره حمد برای او وجود دارد، امام (ع) به آیه «إِیَّاکَ نَعْبُدُ وإِیَّاکَ نَسْتَعِینُ» اشاره کردند و پرسیدند: از چه کسی استعانت می‌جویی؟ این نشان می‌دهد که استعانت باید تنها از خداوند باشد، اما درخواست واسطه از کسانی که نزد خداوند مورد قبول هستند، اشکالی ندارد.\n",
            "\n",
            "بنابراین، توسل به امامان (ع) نه تنها با آیه «کفایت» خداوند منافات ندارد، بلکه در چارچوب توکل به خدا و درخواست واسطه از اولیای الهی قرار می‌گیرد.\n",
